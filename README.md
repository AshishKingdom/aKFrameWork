# aKFrameWork v1.012

Thanks for download my library. You can use this in your project freely 
but use it on your own risk as I'll be responsible for any damage to
your pc done from my libary. I'm not saying that my libary will harm
your computer but USE IT PROPERLY. ;) :)

To use this libary, see it below
'$include:'aKFrameWork_global.bi'
[your code]
[your code]
[your code]
'$include:'aKFrameWork_method.bi'
Yes, include aKFrameWork_global.bi on the top of your program and 
aKFrameWork_method.bi on the bottom of your program.

You can check some cool demo in the 'demo' folder. Also, you can 
read aKFrameWork.pdf in 'doc' folder to know more about SUBS and 
FUNCTION of this framework and how to use it. 

Compile & run FrameworkManager.bas which will help you to create dialog with
WYISWYG editor.
